# Emission Consistency Loss            #

def emission_consistency_loss(sr_output, lr_original, overlapping_factor, patch_size_lr, upscaling_factor):
    '''
    Compute the consistency loss between two tensors, ensuring that the mean of values within corresponding patches in
    the original low-resolution tensor "lr_original" is approx. equal to the mean of values within
    corresponding patches in the super-resolved tensor "sr_output".
    The consistency loss is calculated by comparing patches of the same spatial area in both tensors. The size of these
    patches is determined by the parameter "patch_size", which applies to both dimensions of the low-resolution tensor.
    This patch size is then upscaled by the specified upscaling factor to determine the size of patches in the
    super-resolved tensor.
    The number of patches used for comparison is fixed and computed based on the dimensions of the low-resolution
    tensor "lr_original". The overlapping factor, defined by the parameter "overlapping_factor", determines the extent
    of overlap between adjacent patches in both dimensions of the low-resolution tensor, thus the stride.
    For example, if upscaling from a 3x3 to a 6x6 tensor (thus using a 2x upscaling factor) with a patch size of 2x2
    (on the low-resolution tensor) and an overlapping factor of 1, resulting in a 4x4 patch size on the super-resolved
    tensor, there will be 4 patches in both the lr_original and sr_output tensors. The function ensures that the mean of
    values within each 4x4 patch of the super-resolved tensor is approx. equal to the mean of values
    within the corresponding 2x2 patch of the low-resolution tensor.
    :param sr_output: The super-resolved tensor.
    :param lr_original: The original low-resolution tensor.
    :param overlapping_factor: The factor determining the extent of overlap between adjacent patches.
    :param patch_size_lr: The size of patches (observation window) in the low-resolution tensor.
    :param upscaling_factor: The factor by which the patch size is upscaled to match the super-resolved tensor.
    :return: The consistency loss.
